CapyNFT Marketplace Website Summary
The CapyNFT marketplace combines fun and professional vibes to attract NFT collectors and ensure the website is easy to use. The team picked a blue color scheme (#4e73df) because it looks trustworthy and tech-savvy. They added rounded corners and gentle shadows to make the website feel welcoming. Product cards include:
- Cool hover animations (like lifting and zooming effects) to make exploring fun
- Easy-to-read pricing and badges for quick decisions
- Responsive designs that adjust smoothly between mobile and desktop
- Clear and simple navigation on all pages
- A design that prioritizes NFT images and essential info.

The product pages focus entirely on the NFT artwork, showing important info in expandable sections. Hover effects are designed with CSS transforms for seamless performance.

Who It's For: The website targets:
- NFT collectors (ages 18-45) looking for cool digital art
- Crypto enthusiasts who enjoy lighthearted investments
- Fans of capybaras and animal-themed artwork
- Beginners who want easy explanations about buying NFTs.

It also appeals to:
- Social media users sharing quirky digital items
- Budget-conscious investors entering the NFT world
- Artists diving into capybara-themed art.

Challenges Solved: Hereâ€™s how the team tackled difficulties:
- Consistency: Mixing playful capybara branding with sleek e-commerce tools required creative solutions. They balanced it with mascot branding and clean designs.
- Mobile Optimization: Spacing issues were fixed using Bootstrap grids and customized media queries.
- Hover Issues: Early hover effects interfered with touch actions on mobile, but the team solved this with touch-friendly CSS.
- Speed: Pages were slow at first, so the team sped things up by:- Adding lazy loading
- Compressing images
- Using CSS instead of JavaScript for animations.

- Navigation: Testers found it tricky to move between marketplace and product pages. To fix this, the team added:- Always-visible back buttons
- Breadcrumb navigation (for desktop)
- A better-organized mobile menu.


The end result is a website that mixes fun capybara designs with smooth e-commerce features. Future updates might include AR previews and better social sharing tools to keep users engaged.
